# PNEUMONIA DETECTION WITH DEEP LEARNING USING X-RAY IMAGES

## INTRODUCTION

Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious respiratory infection that affects the lungs. It can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and even certain chemicals or irritants. Pneumonia occurs when these agents enter the lungs and cause inflammation in the air sacs, known as alveoli, which can fill with pus or other fluids. This can make it difficult for the affected person to breathe and lead to a range of symptoms, from mild to severe.

 Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of infectious agents. The most common culprits are bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as viruses like influenza and the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. Fungal and parasitic pneumonia are less common but can occur, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems.Pneumonia symptoms can vary in severity but often include high fever, cough (sometimes with mucus or pus), difficulty breathing, chest pain when breathing or coughing, fatigue, and confusion, especially in older adults. The symptoms may develop gradually or suddenly, depending on the type of pneumonia. Certain factors can increase the risk of developing pneumonia. These include age (very young children and the elderly are more vulnerable), weakened immune systems (due to conditions like HIV/AIDS or cancer treatment), chronic lung diseases (e.g., COPD), smoking, and recent respiratory infections. Doctors often diagnose pneumonia through a combination of physical exams, medical history, and diagnostic tests. These tests may include chest X-rays, blood tests, and sputum cultures to identify the specific pathogen causing the infection.

 Treatment for pneumonia depends on its cause. Bacterial pneumonia is typically treated with antibiotics, while viral pneumonia often requires supportive care, such as rest, fluids, and antiviral medications for some cases. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary to provide oxygen and intravenous fluids. Vaccinations are one of the most effective ways to prevent certain types of pneumonia, such as pneumococcal and influenza pneumonia. Good hygiene practices, including frequent handwashing, can also reduce the risk of infection. Quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to environmental toxins can lower the risk of developing pneumonia in some cases.Most cases of pneumonia can be successfully treated, especially when caught early. However, the outcome depends on various factors, including the individual's overall health, the specific pathogen causing the infection, and the promptness of treatment.

 ## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

 Nairobi hospital has contracted us to develop a machine learning model which can help the hospital diagnose pneumonia from x-ray images. Pneumonia poses a great risk, as a prevalent and impactful respiratory illness, is of paramount importance not only to healthcare providers and institutions but also to society at large. Pneumonia affects healthcare impact, public health implications, economic considerations, global health initiatives and patient-centered approach.

In the domain of health care, the application of machine learning techniques for pneumonia detection represents a significant intersection of technology and medicine. This project recognizes the need for accurate and efficient pneumonia diagnosis, a critical aspect of patient care and public health. From a business viewpoint, the use of deep learning has far reaching implications. It addresses the challenges faced by healthcare providers in terms of timely diagnosis and effective utilization of resources.By automating the detection process the hospital and medical facilities can potentially reduce the workload on radiologists, expedite treatment decisions, and optimize resource allocation. Additionally, this project acknowledges the economic dimension, where improved pneumonia detection can lead to cost savings for healthcare systems and insurers, as early diagnosis often correlates with better treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the development of deep learning model for pneumonia detection aligns with the broader trends of AI integration into healthcare, presenting opportunities for technology companies and startups specializing in healthcare solutions. 

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Pneumonia remains a significant global health concern, contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality rates. Timely and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial for effective patient care and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. However, the current diagnostic process, primarily reliant on radiological imaging and clinical expertise, faces challenges related to resource constraints, delays in reporting, and the potential for human error. This project addresses the critical need for an efficient, automated, and reliable pneumonia detection system using deep learning techniques. The problem at hand is to develop and evaluate a deep learning model that can analyze medical images, such as chest X-rays, to accurately identify and classify pneumonia cases. By doing so, this project aims to enhance the speed and precision of pneumonia diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes and streamlining healthcare resource allocation. 

### Objectives

1.   Develop a model that can detect pneumonia cases from chest x-ray images.
2.   Train the model using the collected dataset, fine-tune it for optimal performance, sensitivity, specificity and speed.
3. Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

## DATA UNDERSTANDING

We have been provided with a dataset from kaggle[Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The data contains three folders:


*   Train set
*   Val Set
*   Test set

Each of the folders has  sub-folders with 'NORMAL'  and 'PNEUMONIA' classes of chest X-ray images. The dataset is 2GB in size.

## Modeling

We created different models and choose the best performing model.

## CONCLUSION

We have managed to develop several models and we have choosed the best performing model. Image classification is crucial task as it deals with human health and an incorrect diagnosis can lead to severe repurcussion. Choosing a model we have to consider the recall and precision as well as f1-score. But for our model we are going to focus on recall  as it measures the ability of your model to capture all positive instances. We are going to prioritize recall over precision. We have met all of our objectives.Our best performing model is 'cnn_best_model.h5'

## RECOMMENDATIONS

We have successfully developed and trained an image classification model for our specific task. The model architecture, based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has proven effective in extracting relevant features from our image data. During testing, our model demonstrated promising results. However, as with any machine learning model, continuous evaluation and refinement are essential. We recommend periodically revisiting the dataset to ensure it remains representative of the target distribution and exploring data augmentation techniques to further improve model robustness. Lastly, considering the interpretability of the model and conducting error analysis can provide valuable insights for further enhancements. Overall, our image classification model serves as a strong foundation, and with ongoing refinement and attention to best practices, we anticipate achieving even better results in the future. Nairobi hospital should incorporate the model to their system as it will lead to faster diagnosis and cut costs for the hospital.
